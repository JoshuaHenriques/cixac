# The Cixac Programming Language (WIP)

The Cixac programming language is a passion project that I decided to pursue with inspiration and guidance from Thorsten Ball's [book](https://interpreterbook.com/). Creating this interpreter is the first (out of three) implementation of my general-purpose programming language that I'll be making.

**Note:** The documentation is currently under construction.
